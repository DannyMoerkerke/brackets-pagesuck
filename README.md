PageSuck - An Extension for Adobe Brackets
==========================================

Welcome to the initial release of PageSuck. PageSuck is an extension to Adobe Brackets that
allows you to pull the contents of any URL directly into your editor. See a webpage where you
wonder 'how did they do that?' Have a page on a remote production server that you would
like to tweak and experiment with using Brackets? With PageSuck installed, simply Alt-G,
type in the full URL and PageSuck will suck the contents of that page directly into a
new editor file for you.

To install
==========

To install this extension, in Brackets choose Help->Show Extensions Folder. In the user directory,
create a directory called ```PageSuck``` and simply place the contents of this repository into
that folder. Then restart Brackets.

Alternatively, if you are using Brackets from the source code, create a ```PageSuck``` folder
inside the ```brackets/src/extensions/user``` folder, and reload Brackets.

**Compatible with Brackets Sprint 18***
